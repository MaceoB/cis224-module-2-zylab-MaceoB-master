## INSTRUCTIONS ##

1. Complete the code for each of the zyLabs in Chapter 2 of the required zyBook (sections 2.19 through 2.24). The
   starter code has already been saved in corresponding folders in this assignment repository.

2. Once your code passes all of the zyBook testing, refactor your code so that each lab has the following structure:
    - All CSS and JS code is saved in external documents, and only HTML code is saved in the .html files
    - Images must be saved in an **img** directory

3. Push your completed repository to GitHub, and copy the repository's final commit link in the Canvas assignment
   submission
